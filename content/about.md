I'm a London based software developer, passionate about building and improving the web.

I've worked for 5+ years at <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, and before that was a member of <a href="http://gofreerange.com">Go Free Range</a>, a small collective of talented, like-minded developers. I've helped build <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a>, <a href="https://mubi.com/">MUBI</a>, and many more.

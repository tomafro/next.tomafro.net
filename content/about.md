<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a London based software developer, passionate about building and improving
  the web. For the last 5 years I've been a programmer at
  <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Previously I was a partner at <a href="http://gofreerange.com">Go Free Range</a>,
  a collective of talented, like-minded developers.
</p>
<p>
  We built the government part of <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a>,
  replacing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations">all UK ministerial
  department websites</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We worked with a small team at the Open University to launch
  <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a> as a successful online course
  provider.
</p>
<p>
  We also worked with other clients including <a href="https://mubi.com/">MUBI</a>,
  <a href="https://www.o2.co.uk">O2</a> and <a href="https://gofreerange.com/projects">many more</a>.
